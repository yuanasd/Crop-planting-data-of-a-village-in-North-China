 A village is situated in the mountainous region of North China, characterized by low temperatures year-round, where most farmland can only support a single crop season annually. 
 The village encompasses 1201 mu of arable land, divided into 34 plots of varying sizes, comprising four types: flat dry land, terraced land, hillside land, and irrigated land. 
 The fields, terraces, and hillsides are conducive to the cultivation of grain crops once per year. 
 In contrast, irrigated lands allow for either one season of rice or two seasons of vegetables each year.

Additionally, the village features 16 conventional greenhouses and 4 smart greenhouses; each greenhouse has a cultivated area of 0.6 mu. 
Conventional greenhouses are suitable for growing one season's worth of vegetables and a seasonal yield of edible fungi annually; however, smart greenhouses can accommodate two vegetable seasons per year. 
Each plot (including those with greenhouses) may be utilized to cultivate different crops in each season.

In accordance with crop growth regulations, no single crop should be planted continuously on the same plot (including within greenhouses), as this practice would diminish yields over time. 
Given that soil enriched with rhizobacteria from leguminous crops benefits subsequent plant growths—starting from 2023—it will be mandatory for every plot (inclusive of all greenhouse soils) to incorporate pulses at least once every three years into their planting schedules. 
Furthermore, planting plans must consider operational convenience and field management factors; thus ensuring that crop rotations within any given plot do not become overly dispersed across individual species during any particular season.
